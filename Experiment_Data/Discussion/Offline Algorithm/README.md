# Discussion: The overheads of PyMOP's offline algorithm (Algorithm A)

## Files included for this analysis:

- `algoA_results.csv`: Raw performance measurements for Algorithm A and other online algorithms across all test projects
- `projects_evaluated_algoA.csv`: List of projects that were evaluated using Algorithm A and other online algorithms
- `generate-algoA-macros.py`: Python script that generates LaTeX macros for performance analysis of Algorithm A and other online algorithms
- `algo_a_overhead_macros.tex`: LaTeX macros containing performance analysis results for Algorithm A and other online algorithms

These files contain the data and analysis scripts used to evaluate the overheads of Algorithm A and other online algorithms in PyMOP, including raw measurements and scripts to process these measurements.

## Steps to run these files:

1. Install Python dependencies
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```

2. Generate performance analysis macros:
   ```bash
   python generate-algoA-macros.py
   ```

## Analysis results:

The generated LaTeX macros can be found in:
- `algo_a_overhead_macros.tex`: Analysis of Algorithm A and other online algorithms' performance metrics and overhead measurements
