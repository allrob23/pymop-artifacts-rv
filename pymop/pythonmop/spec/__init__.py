"""Defines user-facing classes and methods used for defining specs.

The methods/classes in this package can be imported from ``pythonmop.spec.spec``
and ``pythonmop.spec.data``, but since it contains the user-facing components they
can also be imported from ``pythonmop`` directly.

For example, these two imports are equivalent:

.. code-block:: python

    from pythonmop.spec.data import call
    from pythonmop import call
